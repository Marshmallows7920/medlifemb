              <h2>What is MEDLIFE?</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>Well we are a non-profit organization that strives towards empowering developing countries towards equal access to healthcare, education and a safe home. MED is an acronym that encompasses our core goals which is to improve Medicine, Education and Development all around the world. </p>
                <p>We partner with low-income communities in Latin America and Africa in an attempt to eradicate any constraints that poverty may bring. The University of Manitoba MEDlife chapter is one of many university chapters all around the world with the similar goal of advocating for the less fortunate. Within these on-campus chapters we look for motivated students who show passion for helping others. </p>
